Avoid Premature Optimization:
Do not optimize your code before you know the time or memory requirements for that code, or before you know where the bottlenecks are 


Methods to Improve Performance:

1. Your Choice of Algorithm
2. Your choice of data structure
3. Using built-in functions 
4. Compiling Python 
5. Asynchronous Code 
6. Parallel and distributed computing
